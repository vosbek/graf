## 🎯 **What This Does**

Instead of months of manual code analysis, get **complete understanding in weeks**:

- **🔍 Find missing repositories** - Systematic dependency discovery
- **🤖 Ask questions in English** - "What are the payment processing endpoints?"
- **📊 Get migration roadmaps** - AI-powered GraphQL recommendations  
- **🏗️ Understand architecture** - Complete system relationship mapping

Perfect for **Struts → GraphQL migration** planning and **enterprise codebase analysis**.

---

## ⚡ **Quick Start**

### **1. Install & Start (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <this-repo> CodebaseRAG
cd CodebaseRAG

# Set your repositories path
export REPOS_PATH="/path/to/your/repos"

# Start MVP (one command)
./start-mvp-simple.sh
```

### **2. Index Your Application (varies by size)**
```bash
# Add your Struts application
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/index" \
  -d '{"repo_path": "/path/to/struts-app", "repo_name": "my-app"}'
```

### **3. Start Asking Questions (immediately)**
```python
# Natural language interface - no curl needed!
from mvp.example_usage import StrutsAnalysisClient

client = StrutsAnalysisClient()
answer = client.ask("What are all the payment processing endpoints?")
print(answer)
# Returns: "I found 3 payment endpoints: /payment/process for charges, 
#          /payment/refund for refunds, and /payment/validate for validation..."
```

**That's it!** Your team can now analyze the codebase conversationally.

## 🎉 **Success Stories**

*"Instead of spending 6 months trying to understand our legacy Struts application, we had complete analysis in 2 weeks and started confident migration planning immediately."*

*"Business users can now ask questions about our codebase directly instead of waiting for developers to analyze and explain features."*

*"The dependency discovery found 12 missing repositories we didn't even know we needed. It would have taken weeks to find them manually."*
