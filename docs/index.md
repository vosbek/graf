# 📚 Codebase RAG MVP Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Codebase RAG MVP - your natural language interface for Struts application analysis and migration planning.

## 🎯 **What is the MVP?**

The MVP transforms massive Struts applications into query-able knowledge graphs, enabling business users to ask questions in plain English instead of wrestling with technical commands.

**Ask questions like:**
- *"What are all the payment processing endpoints?"*
- *"Show me the user authentication business logic"*
- *"How complex would it be to migrate the order management system?"*
