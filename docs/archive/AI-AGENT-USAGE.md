# ðŸ¤– AI Agent for Struts Migration - Natural Language Interface

## ðŸŽ¯ **No More curl Commands!**

Your MVP now includes an AI agent that lets business users, project managers, and developers ask questions about the Struts codebase in **plain English**.

### **Before: Technical Commands**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/struts/actions?repository=legacy-app"
curl "http://localhost:8080/search/legacy-patterns?pattern=payment"
```

### **After: Natural Language Questions**
```python
# Using the Strand Agents SDK or simple API calls
agent.ask("What are all the payment processing endpoints?")
agent.ask("Show me the user authentication business logic")
```

## ðŸš€ **How to Use the AI Agent**

### **Option 1: Simple HTTP Requests (Python)**
```python
import requests

def ask_agent(question):
    response = requests.post("http://localhost:8080/agent/ask", 
                           json={"question": question})
    return response.json()["answer"]

# Ask questions in natural language
answer = ask_agent("What are all the payment processing endpoints?")
print(answer)
```

### **Option 2: Using Strand Agents SDK**
```python
from agents import AgentService

# Get the initialized agent
agent = AgentService.get_agent()

# Ask questions directly
response = await agent.ask("What features are in the user management section?")
print(response)
```

### **Option 3: Web Interface (FastAPI Docs)**
1. Open: http://localhost:8080/docs
2. Navigate to `/agent/ask` endpoint
3. Click "Try it out"
4. Enter your question in plain English
5. Get intelligent responses

## ðŸŽ¯ **Example Business Questions & Responses**

### **Endpoint Discovery**
**Question:** *"What are all the payment processing endpoints?"*

**AI Response:** 
> "I found 3 main payment processing endpoints in your application:
> 1. **PaymentAction** - Handles credit card transactions at `/payment/process`
> 2. **RefundAction** - Processes customer refunds at `/payment/refund`  
> 3. **PaymentValidationAction** - Validates payment data at `/payment/validate`
> 
> These endpoints handle the core payment functionality including processing new payments, handling refunds, and validating payment information before processing."

### **Business Logic Analysis**
**Question:** *"Show me all the user authentication business logic"*

**AI Response:**
> "I found several components handling user authentication:
> 
> **Login Process:**
> - `LoginAction.java` - Main login endpoint with username/password validation
> - `AuthenticationService.java` - Core authentication business logic
> - `SessionManager.java` - Handles user session creation and management
> 
> **Security Features:**
> - Password encryption using MD5 hashing (recommend upgrading to bcrypt)
> - Session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity
> - Failed login attempt tracking (locks account after 5 attempts)
> 
> **Migration Recommendation:** Consider implementing JWT tokens for stateless authentication in your new GraphQL API."

### **Migration Planning**
**Question:** *"How complex would it be to migrate the order management system?"*

**AI Response:**
> "The order management system has **medium complexity** for migration:
> 
> **Components Found:**
> - 7 action classes handling different order operations
> - 3 data models (Order, OrderItem, OrderStatus)
> - Integration with payment system and inventory
> 
> **Migration Strategy:**
> 1. **Start with read operations** - Convert OrderViewAction to GraphQL queries first
> 2. **Create GraphQL types** - Order, OrderItem, OrderStatus map well to GraphQL schema
> 3. **Handle dependencies** - Order system connects to payment and inventory services
> 
> **Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks with careful dependency management."

### **Security Analysis**
**Question:** *"What security measures are implemented in this application?"*

**AI Response:**
> "I found several security patterns in your Struts application:
> 
> **Authentication & Authorization:**
> - Custom login system with username/password
> - Role-based access control (Admin, User, Guest roles)
> - Session-based authentication
> 
> **Input Validation:**
> - Form validation using Struts validator framework
> - Some SQL injection protection in DAO classes
> - Basic XSS protection in JSP pages
> 
> **Migration Recommendations:**
> - Implement OAuth2 or JWT for modern authentication
> - Add GraphQL input validation at resolver level
> - Consider implementing rate limiting for API endpoints"

## ðŸ“Š **Available Agent Capabilities**

### **What the Agent Can Help With:**
```python
# Get agent capabilities
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8080/agent/capabilities")
print(response.json())
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "description": "AI agent for Struts codebase analysis and migration planning",
  "capabilities": [
    "Find all Struts actions and web endpoints",
    "Search for business logic by concept (e.g., 'payment processing')", 
    "Analyze feature dependencies and complexity",
    "Generate GraphQL migration suggestions",
    "Identify security patterns and requirements",
    "Provide migration planning guidance"
  ],
  "example_questions": [
    "What are all the user management features?",
    "Show me the payment processing business logic", 
    "How many web endpoints does this application have?",
    "What would be involved in migrating the order system?",
    "What security measures are implemented?",
    "Give me GraphQL migration suggestions for this app"
  ]
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Business User Workflow**

### **Step 1: Application Analysis**
```python
# Understand the application structure
ask_agent("What are the main features of this application?")
ask_agent("How many web endpoints are there?")
ask_agent("What business domains are covered?")
```

### **Step 2: Business Logic Discovery**  
```python
# Deep dive into specific areas
ask_agent("Show me all the payment processing logic")
ask_agent("What authentication methods are used?")
ask_agent("How does the order workflow work?")
```

### **Step 3: Migration Planning**
```python
# Get migration guidance
ask_agent("What GraphQL types should I create for this application?")
ask_agent("Which features would be easiest to migrate first?")
ask_agent("What are the main dependencies I need to consider?")
```

### **Step 4: Technical Analysis**
```python
# Technical details for developers
ask_agent("What security patterns need to be preserved?")
ask_agent("Which components have the most dependencies?")
ask_agent("What database tables are accessed by the user features?")
```

## ðŸ”§ **Integration Examples**

### **For Project Managers**
```python
# Quick project assessment
questions = [
    "How many features does this application have?",
    "What would be the migration complexity?", 
    "Which business areas are most complex?",
    "What are the main technical risks?"
]

for question in questions:
    answer = ask_agent(question)
    print(f"Q: {question}")
    print(f"A: {answer}\n")
```

### **For Business Analysts**
```python
# Business process analysis
business_areas = [
    "user management",
    "payment processing", 
    "order management",
    "reporting and analytics"
]

for area in business_areas:
    answer = ask_agent(f"What business logic handles {area}?")
    print(f"=== {area.title()} ===")
    print(answer)
```

### **For Developers**

# Technical deep-dive
technical_questions = [
    "What are all the database dependencies?",
    "Which classes handle user authentication?",
    "What external services are integrated?",
    "How is error handling implemented?"
]

for question in technical_questions:
    answer = ask_agent(question)
    # Process technical details for implementation planning
```
